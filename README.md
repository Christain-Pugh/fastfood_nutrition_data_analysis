🥡 Exploratory Data Analysis: Fast Food Nutrition

📌 Project Overview
This project involves an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of fast food nutritional information sourced from a Kaggle dataset. The primary goal is to identify suitable food options from various fast food chains that align with specific dietary goals.

The dataset includes menu items from six major fast food restaurants:

- McDonald's

- Burger King

- Wendy's

- KFC

- Taco Bell

- Pizza Hut

The analysis focuses on identifying optimal menu choices for the following dietary preferences:

- High-protein, low-calorie

- Calorie-conscious

- Low-sugar

- Red meat–free

For the high-protein and calorie-conscious diets, criteria include:

- A minimum of 10g of protein

- A maximum of 300 calories

This ensures that selecting any two items from this group results in a total caloric intake under 600 while providing a substantial protein boost.

The low-sugar and red meat–free diets focus more directly on the elimination or minimization of specific ingredients, rather than strict macro-nutrient balancing.
